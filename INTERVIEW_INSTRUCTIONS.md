# Interview Instructions

## Summary

In this repo you'll find a `README` file.

This is a historical snapshot of some documentation we provided around
collaboration using `git`.

The README has numerous areas for improvement, please make edits and leverage
the power of `git` to document your thought process. Upon completion, please
submit a pull request and tag @sgharms.

## Time Commitment

Try to limit yourself to 1-2 hours. While there are _many_ possible edits,
prioritize your edits so that we can see how you sequence edits, what
stylistic changes you might make, and what your technical assessment is.

## Conclusion

There's no "right" answer here! We're trying to understand your voice and how
you would mesh with the team and how you're going to help our learners have an
amazing experience.
